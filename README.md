# Analyze_A-B_Results_Project

A/B tests are very commonly performed by data analysts and data scientists. For this project, I will be working to understand the results of an A/B test run by an e-commerce website. My goal is to work through this notebook to help the company understand if they should:

1- Implement the new webpage.

2- Keep the old webpage.

3- Run the experiment longer to make their decision.
